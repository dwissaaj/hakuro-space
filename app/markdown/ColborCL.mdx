## Introduction

There is no special thing from this Lighting, just a RGB 60 watt, there reason I buy this to achieve projection light with Colbor SL20 B. Light Quality is fine, built is just okay, producing light for 60 watt in low tier lighting. If you start a streaming or just go into video content creating it's so nice to add an ambience or even fill light. Since this light small it need a converter for mount bowen free in package.

### Conclusion

I would recomend this lighting for entry level or 60 watt RGB light, if you compare with most famous lighting entry level like Godox it have really big gap term of pricing. This lighting use USB C for power, you can use your powerbank or with NPF battery ( need special slot & sold separate ).
