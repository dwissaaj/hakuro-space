## Introduction

Projection lighting is used by cinematography for creating ambience light, a few photographer use this as a concept this is the reason I bought. I am not a professional but a hobbiyst but here is what I though about this product.
The problem with projection lighting for continous light is **WEIGHT** for example Godox VSA have wight around 7kg with lens, yes they have more smaller projection like Godox BLP but the problem is the glass not intensify light it will make problem if you have less power light like 60 watt.

### Colbor SL20B A Preview

After research the only one I can find is this projection, it has lighter weight and intensify lux power, the downside is when buy this is it only support for their Colbor 100 or 60 watt lighting due to diameter of mounting, for me yeah it's okay we can buy a new one.

### Build Quality

The build quality is amazing, with this price you can get rigid aluminium alloy, the problem is the design. Be honest it sucks, here is why

#### Cons

Be careful if you want tighten or loosing the handle, if way too far it will detach from the bolt BUT WE CAN'T ACCESS THE BOLD FROM INSIDE, this is cause they soldered all the body, so weird. Also they have only right side anchor so very difficult to make it in position not like Godox VSA have both side handle much much stable. Also cause of mounting it only can use light under 100 watt from COLBOR ONLY, but recomended use CL Bi light not their CL RGB ( even though I use rgb), it work fine but have different hex color output. They also didn't give you bag or sell one, till today I using original box for bring and keep it.

### Pros

Price is great, especially for a hobbyist, amateur or even professional. It also give you almost 30+ gobos while other brand sell it separate.

### Conclusion

They need to fix a few thing especially the design, so weird but I recomend this product
